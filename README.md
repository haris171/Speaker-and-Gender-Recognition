# Speaker-and-Gender-Recognition

Using audio files of sample of people, trained a machine learning model from scract to predict two outcome variables:
1. Who is the speaker of this audio?
2. What is the gender of this speaker?

Following functions were used:
1. MFCC library to get MFCC features (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
2. One hot encoding
3. Softmax
4. Grdaient Descent
5. Evaluation (Accuracy and F1 scores)


Accuracy for Gender Recognition is =  84.70588235294117
Accuracy for Speaker Recognition is =  92.25352112676056
